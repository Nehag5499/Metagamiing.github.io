                        <p>The metaverse can be defined as a unified and interoperable VR space where users can interact with each other and the digital world around them through advanced human-computer interaction (HCI) hardware and software.

                            This takes VR gaming to incredible new heights.
                            
                            Currently, VR gameplay is available as standalone applications that you can install on your desktop, VR gear, or mobile phones to engage in an immersive rendition of traditional video games.
                            
                            The main difference is that the in-game universe now appears as a three-dimensional VR world that you can view in 360-degrees and almost “touch” through a realistic sense of perception.
                            
                            The metaverse (first coined in the 1992 science fiction novel, Snow Crash) expands this concept further. It posits that you could connect multiple VR games – and, indeed, any VR application or space – to create a single interoperable environment for users.</p>

            <p>When you look closely for “how to play metaverse games,” you won’t find restricted options. Sorare is the perfect example of opening up the world of gaming to new possibilities. It is basically a football NFT game developed on the foundations of the Ethereum blockchain. Most important of all, over 180 football clubs are officially registered on Sorare, with more clubs joining the platform each week. 

                Players could buy cards on Sorare and create their fantasy teams. The cards represent real players, and the performance of players in real matches could help the cardholders win points. The teams with the most points would have the privilege of creating new cards as a reward every week. In addition, Sorare is one of the top metaverse games to announce a Serie B investment of almost $680 million. Another interesting piece of news about Sorare is that popular game development studio, Ubisoft, has developed a game with the NFTs created on Sorare. 
                
                Sorare is undoubtedly a top pick among online metaverse games with exceptional ease of use. Any individual could create an account in the game without any cost only by using their email and start playing. Players could purchase Sorare NFT cards through debit or credit cards as well as bank transfers. On top of it, people in over 40 countries worldwide could easily purchase Sorare NFT cards.</p>

                                <h3> Illuvium</h3>
<p>Among the big billion-dollar players in the metaverse games list, Illuvium has a special place of its own. It is basically an open-world RPG game developed on the Ethereum blockchain. The fundamental premise of the game revolves around exploring the vast virtual world in it. The primary objective of players in the game would be to collect powerful entities known as “Illuvials.” However, the most striking highlight of Illuvium as one of the best metaverse games is that it has not been released.

    With plans for launching Illuvium in the first quarter of 2022, the game has already garnered a $1 billion market cap. Most of the discussions on Illuvium showcase examples of clips from the actual gameplay experience. Metaverse enthusiasts have verified the exceptional quality of graphics and immersive gameplay as top highlights of Illuvium. 
    
    In addition, the vibrant world in the Illuvium ecosystem filled with colors is definitely a promising detail in the game. However, it may be too soon to claim that Illuvium is one of the top metaverse games right now. On the other hand, the realistic gameplay experience in Illuvium might work in its favor and garner a massive user base. </p>

                                <h3>Ultra</h3>
                                <p>The final addition to a list of online metaverse games would definitely bring Ultra into the equation. It is probably the first blockchain ecosystem driving an entertainment platform offering blockchain-enabled services in different games. The prominent highlight of Ultra as a metaverse game points towards the capability of the network for scaling easily above 12,000 transactions each second. 

                                    You can gain access to different centralized and decentralized services such as discovering, purchasing, playing, and selling games as well as in-game items. Participants could also interact with their favorite influencers and watch live-stream feeds alongside competing in tournaments and contests. Ultra also features a native ERC-20 token known as $UOS, which is available on Uniswap, Bancor Network, Kucoin, Bitfinex, and Bitrue. 
                                    
                                    Ultra is one of the popular metaverse blockchain games with the facility of free and almost instant settlement of transactions. You could also use a $UOS token for staking and earn rewards in the form of super-rare NFTs. The best thing about Ultra is the flexibility for playing games as well as trading on NFT marketplaces. Furthermore, the platform could also help users interact with entertainment services by leveraging new DeFi applications. Just download the wallet for Ultra, and you are ready to create an account for getting started right away. </p>
